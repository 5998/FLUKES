# FLUKES
An automatic reserved engineering threats detection tool “FLUKS”. The tool optimizes and extracts intelligent threat modules using a special designed machine learning algorithm technique, which allows forensic experts to visualize and explore different threats monitored by firewall, IDS/IPS and anti-virus server attacks. When a content of a file is loaded into FLUKS, a representative summary is executed with least significant attacks. It distinguishes the trace changes found in different attacks arc and re-routes the trails of routes back to origin source of attack. Forensic investigators can then determine a set of certain fields relevant to the attack according to the corresponding target.
